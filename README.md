# In File Name - MySQL1
1. Return the categories (names) of the longest film. NOTE that there may be several "longest"
films (i.e. with the same length), so you might need to return more than one category. Return
the duration as well.
2. Find the movies whose total number of actors is above the average. Return the movie names
and its number of actors ordered by the title. IMPORTANT NOTE: this query should return many
movies. Please write in your submission only the first TOP-10 results.

name and the amount spent.
